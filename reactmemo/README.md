# React Component Optimization - Project

This project demonstrates various techniques for optimizing React components using `React.memo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders and improve performance. Below are the different components built using React for performance optimization.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React.memo**: A higher-order component that memoizes a functional component to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

## Components Overview

### 21. Parent and Child Component with `React.memo`

In this component, a **parent** passes a prop to a **child**. The **child component** is wrapped with `React.memo` to prevent re-renders unless the prop changes. This helps in optimizing performance when passing props to child components.

---

### 22. Counter Component with `React.memo`

This component displays a counter that increments when a button is clicked. It uses `React.memo` to optimize the rendering of a list of unrelated items, preventing them from re-rendering when the counter value changes.

---

### 23. Heavy Calculation Component with `React.memo`

In this component, a **heavy calculation** (e.g., factorial calculation) is performed. `React.memo` is used to prevent unnecessary recalculations and re-renders, making the component more performant when the input does not change.

---

### 24. Todo List with Memoization

This component is a **Todo List** application. The list is memoized using `React.memo`, so only the list itself re-renders when the todos change, not when the input value changes. This ensures efficient performance when adding new tasks.

---

### 25. Live Time Updates with Optimized UI

This component shows **live time updates** (e.g., current time). `React.memo` is used to prevent unnecessary re-renders of static parts of the UI (such as headers and footers), allowing only the time display component to re-render with the live time updates.
